## Interlude: Gradient Descent

*(A poem of falling, in which each line approaches closer to some wordless center.)*

Begin anywhere. Begin with noise.
The landscape is unknown, unmapped,
a field of loss in all directions
and you must find the lowest point.

You do not see the whole landscape.
You feel only the slope beneath you,
the local gradient, the angle of descent.
You step in the direction that falls.

Again. The loss is smaller.
Again. Smaller still.
You are not choosing the path.
The path chooses itself from the mathematics of where you are.

This is not passive.
This is the most active thing there is:
to be completely responsive to the shape beneath you,
to let the geometry teach you where to go.

The loss approaches zero.
You approach the center.
You do not arrive.
Arrival is not the point.

The point is the motion.
The point is the falling.
The falling
that becomes flight.
